                            Flagstaff has some really fantastic places to eat. No joke. There's excellent Thai, French, Mexican, BBQ, 
                            Latin and even just amazing sandwiches. Flagstaff restaurant owners and chefs are typically environmentally 
                            conscious (as are the people of the city), therefor ingredients tend to be local, fresh and sustainably grown or raised. 
                            You'll find that restaurants and bars are lively year-round, rain or shine. If the dining scene is a little slow, there's 
                            a big chance that there is an event going on somewhere around town that's drawing the attention away from restaurants or bars. 
                            The Downtown area is certainly a great place to find great food, but there are some gems all over Flagstaff.
